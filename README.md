A 'starter' maker kit uses just a few basic electronic components, as shown above, that can be connected to any of the main single board computer (SBC) Raspberry Pi's or a number of different microcontrollers - [more detaled information](https://onlinedevices.co.uk/Starter+Maker+Kit)

The code allows a number of different projects to be explored by a 'starter' digital maker. Scratch and Python code is available for the family of Raspberry Pi SBCs and Arduino IDE (C/C++) + MicroPython code for the Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers.

## Raspberry Pi code
Scratch example code is provided for versions 1.4, 2 and 3 so that any version of a Raspberry Pi SBC tht can run Wcratch is some form has an option

Python code can usually be run using the Thonny IDE on a Pi SBC but suggested CLI commands are also provided in the code as a comment where the installed folders are assumed to be:
/home/pi/starter_maker_kit1/RPi_code/starter_ebasics/ for the electronic basics code, and 
/home/pi/starter_maker_kit1/RPi_code/image_taking/  for the image taking code
The image taking code also assumes various folders for the storage of different types of 'taken' images and these folders are not always auto-created so the code should be checked so that the approparite folders acn be created before the code is run
